# RemoterSA
A simple standalone GUI lets you specify a list of clients that are to be controlled. You can __WakeOnLAN/Reboot/Shutdown__ clients and __start/restart/kill__ processes on them. Also basic WatchDog functionality is implemented that watches processes on remote clients and restarts 
them or the whole client in case the process cannot be found.

Basically a UI for [PsTools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/pstools) and some more..
